      <td class="text_normal">The Traffic Simulator
Configuration Tool (TSCT) is a powerful tool for adjusting the
configuration of the NAM Unified Traffic Simulator (known as the NAM
Simulator for short) and its associated data views to your liking. Only
those aspects of the simulator that are completely safe for the player
to modify are included in the TSCT; if you follow the instructions
here, you don't have to worry about unexpected side effects, no matter
what settings you use. Nevertheless, changing the settings available in
the TSCT can have a big effect on your game, ranging from changing your
city's income or expenses to changing the congestion levels of traffic,
which in turn can have many secondary effects. &nbsp;For a more
complete understanding of many of these fields, and of the traffic
simulator in general, please see <span id="msg_310570"><a href="http://sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=10261.0" target="_blank">A Guide to the Operation of the Traffic
Simulator</a></span>.<br>






      <br>






Since the NAM Simulator is essentially a generalized form of Simulator
Z, the TSCT can be used to modify the configuration of Simulator Z, if
that is what you are currently running. The result of such a
modification is a version of the NAM Simulator that is completely
compatible with Simulator Z.<br>






      <br>






The TSCT can be used to update your current copy of the NAM Simulator
to the latest version, change your settings in the NAM Simulator and
its associated data views, or switch your traffic simulator to the NAM
Simulator from one of the earlier traffic simulators. Although the NAM
Simulator is generally used with the rest of the NAM, it does not
require the NAM, so the TSCT can also be used to install the NAM
Simulator and optionally its data views in a game that is not running
the NAM.<br>






      <br>






This User's Guide will describe the procedure of selecting a traffic
simulator to modify, how all the fields in the TSCT work on the
selected simulator, what effects these various fields have, and the
various ways of saving your changes. It will start with the <strong>Base
Network Capacity</strong> and the <strong>Network Capacity
Multiplier</strong>, which are generally the most heavily used
fields in the TSCT. After that, it will describe the fields in the
order in which they appear in the main TSCT window.</td>

changes made to your traffic simulator take effect immediately, the
time it takes for these changes to show up in your traffic patterns
will vary greatly, depending on the change. &nbsp;<strong>Some
changes will show up immediately in your traffic patterns, some changes
will show up the next time the traffic simulator runs (about once every
four months), and some changes may take up to eight years to fully
manifest.</strong> For longer-term changes, you can tell when the
change is complete by looking at the Traffic Volume Graph.
&nbsp;When it shows basically stable traffic patterns for at
least&nbsp;two years, then you can be confident that the change has
completely manifested in your city.<br>

For the <strong>Costs and Scaling Factors</strong>
section,
the original value for each field is given to make it easy to restore
these to their original values if you want. As mentioned above, first
the <strong>Base Network Capacity</strong> and the <strong>Network
Capacity Multiplier</strong> will be described, followed by the
other fields starting from the top of the main window.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="blau">Base Network Capacity</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">If you want to change to one
of the other standard capacity versions of the NAM Simulator, use the
drop-down box labeled &ldquo;Base Network Capacity&rdquo; to
choose the capacity you want. (This box is located near the left, about
two-thirds of the way down the window in <span class="blau">blue
letters</span>.) Capacities range from "Classic" (the lowest) to
"Ultra" (the highest). Generally, you would use "Classic" for rural
areas and towns, while "Ultra" is generally recommended only for cities
of many millions of Sims.<br>






      <br>






The other levels ("Low", "Medium", and "High") provide intermediate
capacities; which one of these you choose depends on the size of your
city, how much mass transit you have, and how much congestion
you&rsquo;re prepared to deal with. Cities with a lot of mass
transit need less network capacity than cities with little mass
transit. Once you make your selection, the network capacities used for
that level are displayed in the row of boxes directly above the
drop-down box.<br>






      <br>






You can change you simulator&rsquo;s capacity at any point in your
city&rsquo;s development without penalty. The game must not be
running at the time, however. (This last point applies to all simulator
and data view changes.) If you just want to build big cities and want a
capacity that will handle that comfortably without ever having to
change it, using the default "High" capacity should work fine.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="blau">Network Capacity Multiplier</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">If you want to use a capacity
level that is in between the five main levels, or outside the range of
these levels, you can use the<strong> Network Capacity Multiplier</strong>.
This field multiplies the base capacity by the number in the spin box,
which may range from 0.1 to 2.0. If you change the number in the spin
box, you will immediately see the network capacity numbers in the row
of boxes above this field change accordingly. For proper operation of
the traffic simulator, the proportion of the various network capacities
at a given base network capacity is fixed. However, this proportion
varies slightly among the various base capacities, with rails having
proportionately higher capacities as the base network capacity
increases. You can use this information along with the <strong>Network
Capacity Multiplier</strong> to create capacity spreads to your
liking.<br>






      <br>






For most capacity levels, the background color in the row of boxes
labeled "Capacities" will be green. However, at higher capacity levels,
some boxes will turn yellow, and at even higher capacities, some boxes
will turn red. There is nothing wrong with using these higher
capacities, but the different colors are used to signify a warning
about the display of the Traffic Volume Data View. Although the amount
of traffic that can flow through a network is effectively unlimited,
the Traffic Volume Data View (which shows the traffic for a single
commute period) cannot display values higher than 64K - 1 (65,535).
Normally, the Traffic Volume Data View will display up to 300% of the
network capacity for a given commute period (which is half of the
standard network capacity), at which point it displays solid red.<br>






      <br>






However, if this 300% number is greater than 64K, the full range of
volumes cannot be displayed, and the color range of the Traffic Volume
Data View is adjusted so that its maximum is just under 64K. (This
limitation affects the Route Query Tool as well when it is positioned
over a network.) For these situations, the background color of the
capacity box in the TSCT program will be shown as yellow. If the
capacities are set so high that even 200% of the network capacity for a
commute period (in other words, the full network capacity for a single
day) is greater than 64K, then the background color of the capacity box
in the TSCT program will be shown as red. Again, the operation of the
game is not affected, as SC4 keeps track of volumes greater than 64K,
and even uses them to correctly display the Traffic Congestion Data
View; this is simply a limitation on the display in the Traffic Volume
Data View and the Route Query Tool.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">This drop-down box controls
the preference of Sims for mass transit over cars. There are six
selections here, including five fixed options that range from Low to
Very High. The "Medium" selection corresponds to what is typically
found in large American cities with fairly comprehensive mass transit
systems, while the "High" selection corresponds to many large European
cities with even more comprehensive mass transit systems. The actual
preference of each type of Sim (R$, R$$, and R$$$) for mass transit in
each of these five levels is reflected in the grayed-out array of nine
boxes to the right of the drop-down box, which changes whenever the
selection in the drop-down box is changed.<br>






      <br>






The first column in this array represents the percentage of Sims who
prefer to use mass transit, the second column represents the percentage
of Sims who prefer to use cars, and the third column represents the
percentage of Sims who prefer to use whichever travel method is
fastest. Note that these are only preferences, and do not specify which
travel method the Sims will actually use. If the travel times for the
two methods are close, then the Sims will use the preferred method. But
if one travel method is significantly faster than the other, then the
Sims will use that one.<br>






      <br>






It is also possible to modify the travel method percentages directly by
choosing the "Custom" entry in the drop-down box. If this is done, then
the array is no longer grayed out, and it is possible to change the
individual entries in the spin boxes. Since the entries represent
percentages, each row must add up to 100.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">This field increases the
speed of buses on highways slightly, with the corresponding result that
the number of Sims taking buses that travel on highways will also
increase. This is similar to what happens with real-world highway bus
lanes. The automata aren't changed, however, in that cars will still be
present in all lanes, although the number of buses should be somewhat
greater. From a visual point of view, you can consider that the bus
lanes also allow high occupancy traffic of other types as well.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">This field changes the way
the game works so that cars cannot take the Sims directly to their
workplace. Instead, they are useful only for taking them to parking
facilities where they can either walk the rest of the way to work, or
(most usefully) parking facilities where they can take mass transit to
work. In the second case, you need to build such parking facilities
near mass transit stations; putting them at the edge of residential
zones can be especially useful. If this option is checked and
sufficient parking facilities are not built, the Sims will end up
driving all the way to work and then discover that they have no place
to leave their car. As a result, they don't make it to work, they get
fired, and they leave town, leaving behind an abandoned residence.<br>






      <br>






Parking facilities that are included in the models of various buildings
generally don't count for the purposes of Park &amp; Ride, because
these parking facilities are generally just eye candy. However, parking
facilities that are part of mass transit stations (such as the standard
Maxis train station) almost always are functional, and therefore work
well in Park &amp; Ride systems.</p>

      
      <p class="text_normal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buses contribute to traffic</span></p>

      
      <p class="text_normal">In the original Maxis traffic simulator,
buses did not contribute to traffic congestion; the pathfinder was not
tuned tightly enough to make this workable even if it had been desired.
&nbsp;Experiments showed that turning this field on in the original
simulator would have simply increased the existing traffic congestion
without having any significant benefit.</p>

      
      <p class="text_normal">However, in the NAM traffic simulator, the
pathfinder has been tuned so that it is much more intelligent than in
the original Maxis traffic simulator, and it is now possible to allow
buses to contribute to traffic (just like every other vehicle travel
type) without creating any problems. &nbsp;In fact, the traffic
simulation as a whole runs much better this way. &nbsp;The reason for
this is that in the original Maxis traffic simulator, buses became the
travel type of last resort; if congestion on the roads or most rails
became too great, the traffic simulator could always cram more Sims
into buses and thereby reduce congestion arbitrarily, since all the
road networks had an infinite capacity for buses. This was highly
unrealistic, and had the Sims at times abandoning faster forms of
transport for buses simply to avoid congestion.</p>

      
      <p class="text_normal">The current NAM traffic simulator avoids
this problem by letting buses contribute to traffic. &nbsp;However,
buses, like all vehicles in SC4, are really single-passenger vehicles,
and so some of their usefulness is lost in that they are now no more
efficient than cars at transporting Sims. &nbsp;However, they are still
very useful for those Sims who prefer to use mass transit, and even
more importantly, they are extremely efficient at ferrying Sims to high
speed rapid transit (i.e., the various rail networks) where no parking
exists. &nbsp;So although each setting of this property has certain
drawbacks, the traffic simulator works better and provides a more
accurate traffic simulation when this field is checked, which is its
original state..</p>

      
      <p class="text_normal">However, some people like the way the
original Maxis traffic simulator worked, or they just like to have
increased use of buses. &nbsp;For these people, this field can be
unchecked, and the behavior of the original Maxis traffic simulator
will be restored with regard to buses. If this is done, though, the
traffic simulation as a whole becomes slightly degraded as a result.
&nbsp;The amount of degradation is fairly minimal, though, so as long
as it is understood that this happens, unchecking this field should not
cause any major problems.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">These boxes specify how many
simoleons your city collects each time the named travel type passes
over a single tile. These are called "fares" because by default, only
mass transit travel types have these set to nonzero values. By raising
or lowering these numbers, you can raise or lower the fares for any
travel type. The Sims don't actually pay the fares; the city just
collects them. This is a limitation of the simulation. Also, raising or
lowering the fares has no effect on the Sims' travel habits. Instead,
it can either be used as a device for generating more revenue for your
city's treasury, making the game easier, or for subsidizing the Sims'
mass transit use, which generates less revenue for the city and makes
the game harder.<br>

This feature works in an interesting way in that the fares for a given
travel type are permanently attached to a network tile when it is
built. This means that if you change all the fares and then start up
your game, you will find no immediate change in your monthly income.
However, any new network tiles you build will have the new fares
attached to them. This property allows fares to be used in an
interesting way. Suppose you want to build a toll road, but instead of
clunky toll booths (they're so 20th century), you want sensors in the
road to automatically detect vehicle travel and collect tolls
automatically, according to the distance traveled.<br>






      <br>






Furthermore, you want different tolls for cars, buses, and trucks.
Using this field, this is easy to do. You set the bus fare to the
normal bus fare plus what you want the toll for buses to be, and you
set the car and truck fares to what you want their tolls to be. Then
you start the game, build your toll road, save the game, exit, and
reset the fares for buses, cars and trucks to what they were before.
Now you have a special toll road in your game that collects the tolls
you specify whenever anyone drives over it. No slowing down of traffic,
no traffic jams - just silent toll collection.<br>






      <br>






There are many other possibilities here. You can even charge
pedestrians to walk on your toll roads. And you can create toll
bridges, toll tunnels, and toll streets, among other things. You can
even create municipal parking lots or garages where the Sims pay the
city to park. Just set them one tile back from the road, and connect
them with a street or road tile that has its fares set to be the
parking costs you want. You collect both when the Sims enter and when
they leave.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">These boxes specify how much
the city's treasury is charged each month for a single tile of each
network type. Unlike <strong>Monthly Fares per Sim per Tile</strong>,
changes to these costs take effect the next time you start the game.
Normally, these costs are considered maintenance costs. But they can
also be considered to incorporate construction costs as well,
especially since construction costs aren't directly available to the
traffic simulator. In reality, governments don't pay cash for large
transportation projects; why should your city? Instead, governments
will often issue bonds. So you can consider that the monthly costs also
cover the cost of interest-only bonds that your city has issued to pay
for the network. Since these bonds are interest-only, payments on them
continue forever (or at least until the network is demolished). As with
      <strong>Monthly Fares per Sim per Tile</strong>,
changes to this field provide a simple way to make the game either
easier or more difficult.</p>


      
      
      <p class="text_normal">You may notice that the monthly cost for
the RHW network tiles is set to zero and that this setting cannot be
changed. &nbsp;The reason for this is that the RHW is based on an
unused network that was incompletely implemented by Maxis in SC4.
&nbsp;One of the things that was not implemented in this network was
the monthly cost per network tile, and although this value can be set
internally in the traffic simulator, the game always acts as if it is
zero.</p>

number of customers that a particular business receives is directly
proportional to the inverse of this coefficient; what this implies is
that a given percentage increase or decrease in this number will have

Road noise has the opposite effect on residences. &nbsp;The higher
the road noise, the less desirable the residence becomes.
&nbsp;(Customers translate directly into desirability for
businesses.) &nbsp;However, the desirability effect for residences
is much less than for businesses, so in general, increasing the number
in this field will have a positive effect on the city's economy.
&nbsp;Commercial services are affected more than commercial
offices, and within each commercial type, higher wealth levels are
affected more than lower wealth levels. &nbsp;The last statement is
true of the noise effect on residences as well, although as mentioned
earlier, it is much less than on commercial buildings.<br>

Overall, this number can have a very powerful effect on a city's
economy. &nbsp;At its maximum, which is 3.000, you can cause a
major
economic expansion, although all that activity and noise can make busy
residential areas less desirable for Sims, especially high-wealth ones.
&nbsp;When this number is at its minimum, which is 0.001, business
activity drops significantly, and you can have a major recession on your hands. &nbsp;Of course, the reduced
activity
makes your city a nice, quiet, desirable place for high-wealth Sims to
live. &nbsp;But they may no longer be able to find jobs, so they
may
leave town anyway. &nbsp;(Original value: 0.250)</p>

simulates the speed reductions caused by stoplights, stop signs, and
turning traffic by reducing network capacity at intersections and the
two squares approaching them. This means that at intersections with
heavy traffic, congestion will occur and slow down the traffic. Due to
the way the simulator works, it can delay the traffic for no more than
about six seconds, which is shorter than any standard stoplight cycle.
However, even to do this much, network capacity has to be reduced to
the point where the two squares approaching an intersection show up as
red in the Traffic Congestion Data View. By default, the NAM Simulator
has this effect set so that the maximum delay occurs only at very busy
intersections. Wherever you see all green surrounding an intersection
in the Traffic Congestion Data View, traffic is not slowing down at
all; there is effectively no traffic control at that intersection.<br>






      <br>






This field allows you modify the strength of the intersection effect by
changing the amount of capacity reduction. Making the number in this
field larger reduces the capacity around intersections further,
strengthening this effect; making the number smaller reduces the
effect. The effect can be essentially turned off by reducing the number
in this field to .2, which is as low as it will go. The reason it
doesn't go all the way to zero is that there is always some effect in
the intersection itself. It is necessary to keep at least that small
effect in order to maintain compatibility with NWM, where many types
roads appear to the game to be a continuous series of intersections.

Scaling Factor</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal"><strong>Please note:
The Commute Time Graph was not implemented properly in SC4, and as a
result, it is impossible to configure it to give consistently correct
readings.</strong> Nevertheless, many people like to use this
graph, and on occasion, it can provide useful information.<br>






      <br>






The original Maxis traffic simulator (as well as all versions of
Simulators C, D, and E) allowed the Sims a mere six minutes to get from
their homes to their jobs. This obviously seemed awfully short even to
Maxis, who multiplied this number by 25 in the original Commute Time
Graph. This ratio of 25:1 is also reflected in places such as the Prima
Guide, which claims that the Sims have 2.5 hours to reach their jobs -
exactly 25 times six minutes. You can restore this original factor to
the Commute Time Graph display by setting this field to 1. However, you
will get some ridiculously high numbers on your graph, since the NAM
Simulator does not limit commute times to six minutes.<br>






      <br>






You might expect that to see the actual commute time, you would simply
set this scaling factor to 0.04, which is the decimal equivalent of
1/25. This actually works in small cities that have no neighbors. There
are some anomalies in the way that commute times are computed, though,
and these start to show up in larger cities. The whole picture changes
if you have neighboring cities, though. The average commute time starts
increasing in proportion to the amount of traffic you have between
cities. This may sound reasonable in theory, but in practice you can
end up with one-way commute times of twelve hours or more, even with a
scaling factor of 0.04.<br>






      <br>






For these reasons, the scaling factor in the NAM Simulator has been set
to 0.015. This results in commute times that are too short if you have
just a small, single city, but it gives commute times that are too long
if you have a big city with a large amount of intercity traffic. For
average size cities with an average amount of intercity traffic, it
gives commute times that are approximately correct. You may still see
commute times vary greatly from one city to the next, though, even
though the two cities may be very similar in everything except the
amount of traffic going in and out of them.<br>






      <br>






In any case, the scaling factor is now available for you to adjust to
whatever value seems to make sense to you. You may still want to adjust
it from one city to the next, though, even in the same region. In
general, to get reliable information about the commuting habits of your
Sims, the Route Query Tool, Traffic Data Views, and Traffic Volume
Graph will be much more helpful than the Commute Time Graph. (Note that
the Traffic Volume Graph shows the number of trips, and not commute
times. Also, Sims who take multiple forms of transportation to get to
work will show up in multiple places on this graph.)

      <p class="text_normal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span></p>



      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">This field specifies the maximum time in
minutes that Sims are allowed to take to reach their jobs in the
morning commute. &nbsp;(The evening commute never has any time limit.)
&nbsp;This is the only field of its type that is grayed out in the
Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool, and the reason for this is that
setting the value in this field too low can have extreme negative
consequences for your game. &nbsp;The field can be enabled by checking
the box next to it. &nbsp;The default value of 600, which translates
into ten hours, may seem quite excessive, and in fact may seem to imply
an impossibly long work day for the Sims. &nbsp;However, time does not
flow quite as you would expect in this game when there is traffic to
other cities; this effect was discussed in the previous section, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Time Graph
Scaling Factor</span>.
Before the current &nbsp;value for perfect pathfinding was discovered,
a value this high was required for effective intercity commuting.
Although this is no longer the case, higher values, at least up to 600,
do seem to provide a slightly positive effect on a city's health,
without providing any negative effects. &nbsp;Raising this value beyond
600 does not seem to have any effect at all.</p>



      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">What are the effects of lowering this
value? &nbsp;Once it becomes substantially lower than 600, there is
often a small decline in the general wealth levels of &nbsp;the city.
&nbsp;This decline tends to be rather small, though, and is often
noticeable only by examining the Pop &amp; Jobs graph over many years.</p>



      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">Reducing this value down into the double
digits starts to have more of an effect. &nbsp;Normally, all commutes
within a given city are Short, and all commutes to neighboring cities
are Long. &nbsp;Short commutes give a slight increase to the
desirability of a Sim's residence, while Long commutes result in a
slight decrease in desirability. &nbsp;Medium commutes have no effect
on desirability.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">As the value of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span>
continues to drop, some of the longest commutes within the city will
become Medium, making their originating residences less desirable
compared to the residences of Sims who have Short commutes. &nbsp;As <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span>
drops even further, some Long commutes will start appearing in the
city, and the residences from which those commutes originate will have
even lower desirability. &nbsp;Jobs with a Long commute in the current
city have lost their built-in advantage over jobs in a neighboring
city, so that paradoxically, there is a certain lower range of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span>
where it becomes more attractive to many Sims to look for jobs in
adjacent cities than in their own. &nbsp;This may also aggravate any
eternal commuter loops that may be present in the region.</p>



      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">Once <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span>
starts falling into the single digits (and sometimes slightly before),
the probability that Sims will find jobs for which they are qualified
starts to decline, because there is just no longer time to reach them.
&nbsp;When this happens, the dreaded No-Job Zot appears over the Sims'
homes, and if they can't find a job within about six months, the Sims
leave town, and their residence is abandoned due to commute time.
&nbsp;At these levels of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span>,
traffic routes and congestion levels become much more important,
because every second counts in determining whether Sims will keep their
jobs. &nbsp;This whole situation can become quite challenging, but it
is because many people like this type of challenge that this option has
been included in the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool.</p>



      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">For reference, the original game had a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span> of six minutes. &nbsp;In the Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool, this field can be set as low as one minute.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">This field specifies the
fraction of normal air pollution that vehicles emit when the Clean Air
Act is enabled. Normally, the unmodified Clean Air Act doesn't affect
vehicle air pollution at all; even stranger, neither does the
Automobile Emission Reduction Act. Instead, both of these ordinances
affect all types of air pollution except vehicle air pollution. Each of
these ordinances reduces all other air pollution by 10%; the effect of
these two ordinances is additive.<br>






      <br>






Some people may have noticed that even in the unmodified Sim City 4,
vehicle air pollution can get so bad that you can actually use the air
pollution data view to see a street map of your city. With the addition
of custom content that provides the possibility of much denser cities,
along with greater traffic higher-capacity traffic simulators to
support such cities, this problem only becomes worse. This is why in
the NAM Simulator, enabling the Clean Air Act reduces vehicle pollution
by 60%.<br>






      <br>






However, you may think that's too much of a reduction. Or, you may want
to get rid of vehicle air pollution completely as part of an effort to
run a "green" city. This field allows you to adjust the amount of
vehicle air pollution to your liking. You can drop it all the way down
to zero, or you can raise it all the way up to two, giving you twice
the vehicle air pollution of the standard game. This last option can be
useful when building cities where pollution controls are unheard of.

      <br>






If there is a standard traffic simulator already in this folder, you
will be asked if this is your active traffic simulator folder (usually
your NAM folder). If you say "Yes," then any existing traffic simulator
will be deleted; if there is a custom simulator (i.e., one created by
this program), it will be renamed to have a ".sav" extension, possibly
followed by a number. The same procedure is followed if your Traffic
Volume Data View file has been changed.<br>






      <br>






If you didn't specify a NAM folder or an initial simulator to modify at
the beginning, pressing the "Save" button will bring up a folder dialog
box that will allow you to select a folder in which to save your
changed files. You can also use the "Save As" command in the "File"
menu to force the program to allow you to choose a folder to save your
changed files. If you make changes to your simulator and then decide
you don't like them, you can click the "Reset" button. This will set
all fields in the program to what they were when your simulator was
loaded or created, or when it was last saved, whichever is more recent.</span>

      <p><span class="text_normal">The TSCT can be
used to create a traffic simulator that closely emulates any of the
simulators from recent NAM releases - specifically, simulators A
through E and their variations. (As the TSCT uses the core of Simulator
Z as a base, no emulation of that simulator is necessary.) This section
describes what is necessary to create such emulations. If you try
certain settings for an emulation and they aren't quite what you want,
simply change them; no lasting harm will come to your city from using
settings that are somewhat different from what you used before.<br>






      <br>






An important point to note is that for many of these simulator
emulations, the usage mix of mass transit types may be different from
what you're used to. Specifically, if you have a lot of rapid transit
(i.e., rails), bus usage may be lower. The reason for this difference
is simple: The Sims are smarter now. They will almost invariably take
the fastest route for the morning commute. So if you have bus lines
that parallel rapid transit, the Sims will take the rapid transit
instead of the buses. The easiest way to get more of the rapid transit
mix that you're used to is to add more bus stops, and perhaps reduce
the number of rapid transit stations. Note that the game treats trams
as rapid transit. You may also want to turn on the <strong>Highway
Bus Lanes</strong> option, although sometimes the Sims will be
very clever and just use these speedier highway buses to get to the
rapid transit faster.</span><br>

      <span class="text_zwischentitel">Specific settings
recommended for emulating the older simulators</span></p>






      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">For <em>all</em>
of the older simulators, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Buses contribute to traffic</span> should be unchecked, <strong>Vehicle Air Pollution</strong>
should be set to 0.90, and <strong>Commute Time Graph Scaling
Factor</strong> should be set to 1.000.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">
For all of the older simulators except <span style="font-style: italic;">Simulator B</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Customers/Traffic Noise Coefficient</span> should be set to 0.128. &nbsp;For Simulator B, this coefficient should be set to 0.096.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">For <em>Simulators A</em> and <em>B</em>, the
base network capacity
of "Low", "Medium", and "High" roughly corresponds to these simulators'
"Hard", "Medium", and "Easy" levels. However, congestion at a given
capacity level in the NAM Simulator is usually much less than
congestion at the corresponding capacity level of Simulators A or B.
Therefore, you may wish to use a lower capacity level for these
simulators, or make a finer adjustment using the <strong>Network
Capacity Multiplier</strong>. What is necessary here depends on
lot on your cities, and specifically how much rapid transit you use.
The more rapid transit you use, the less network capacity you will
need. Conversely, a city with little or no rapid transit will tend to
require capacity levels very similar to the ones used in Simulators A
and B to provide similar congestion levels.<br>






      <br>






For <strong>Mass Transit Usage</strong>, a setting of
either "Medium High" or "Medium" should work well for a Simulator A or
B emulation. For cities with lots of rapid transit, a setting of
"Medium" will generally provide a better emulation. For both of these
simulators, the <strong>Intersection Effect Multiplier</strong>
should be set to 0.2.<br>






      <br>






For <em>Simulators C, D,</em> and <em>E</em>, the capacity settings
of "Classic", "Low", and "High" roughly correspond to the "Standard",
"2x", and "5x" capacities of these simulators. For Simulator E, these
capacities should be used as they are, possibly adjusting "High"
downward slightly using the <strong>Network Capacity Multiplier</strong>.
For Simulator D, lower capacities will be required to produce the same
congestion effects as experienced in this simulator, and Simulator C
will require still lower capacities. The exact capacities required
depend on the cities in which these simulators are used.<br>






      <br>






For <strong>Mass Transit Usage</strong>, a setting of
"Medium" to "Medium High" is recommended for Simulator C, "Medium High"
to "High" is recommended for Simulator D, and "High" to "Very High" is
recommended for Simulator E. For all three of these simulators, the <strong>Intersection
Effect Multiplier </strong>should be set to 0.4.</p>



      
      
      
      <p class="text_normal">For all versions of <span style="font-style: italic;">Simulators C, D, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">E</span>, the value of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commute Trip Max Time</span> should be set to 6. &nbsp;For Simulator A, this value should be set to 17, and for Simulator B, it should be set to 24.</p>
