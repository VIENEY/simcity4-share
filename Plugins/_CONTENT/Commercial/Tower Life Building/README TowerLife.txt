TOWER LIFE BUILDING

Origin:  San Antonio, USA.
Created by  Odainsaker.

The crowning masterpiece of architects Ayers & Ayers.  Completed in 1929 in restrained late-Gothic Revival style, its observation decks decorated with terra-cotta and festooned with gargoyles offer grand views of the city.  Originally named the Smith-Young Tower after its developers, this was for over twenty years the tallest building in Texas and home to the city's top architects, lawyers, and insurers.  Intended as the initial centerpiece of a new downtown commercial center of landmark high-rises, the tower would never see its envisioned sister buildings completed, for the shocking onset of the Depression would crush further grand building projects.  The building is currently named the Tower Life Building after its primary tenant, Tower Life Insurance.  With its glittering wedding-cake crown flood lit at night, this tower remains among the most popularly recognized and admired skyscrapers in San Antonio.

Some creative modifications were done for this BAT model, blending the best elements of the original Smith-Young Tower with the current Tower Life Building.  Currently, the streetlevel storefront windows of the actual building have been walled in for offices, but I have opened them back up as though the old department stores were still there.  The original store marquee sign was left off, but the striking addition of the modern transmitter mast atop the cupola was kept.  The brick party wall with its exterior firestairs and valet parking canopy was recreated in preference for the currently adjoining parking garage structure.  Lastly, the grand entry was restored to its original portal configuration, leaving off the later airlocking gold entrance doors.
