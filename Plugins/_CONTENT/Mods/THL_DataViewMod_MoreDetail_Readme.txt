== Description ==

This mod increases the detail visible on the high end of the color spectum for the Desirability, Mayor Rating, and Land Value data views, allowing more distinction where areas of a city used to be solid green. It also increases the max value visible on the Mayor Rating Graph from 100 to the game maximum of 128.

The number of jobs available on a lot is directly proportional to the desirability of the area it's in, so lots with a desirability of less than 50% will have under half thier normal capacity filled. This is now indicated by red.

"Default" mayor rating (without any other effects) is around 30, this is now brown. Anything below default rating is red to clear (rock bottom for mayor rating and health/education effects is transparent, since that's what non-residential zones display).
