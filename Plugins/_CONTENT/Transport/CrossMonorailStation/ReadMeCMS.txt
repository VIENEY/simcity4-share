CROSS MONORAIL STATION by KORSFERD
Including the functionality of a monorail, subway and bus station plus a garage capacity, this station was designed to be used in intersections between monorail lines. The idea is to save space without the connection headache of a rail roundabout. It will reduce the need of spamming stations a little. I hope someone find it useful and enjoy using this station as I like to BAT and put it to work in my cities.
