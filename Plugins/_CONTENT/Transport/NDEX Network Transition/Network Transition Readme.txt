Description: a fully-functioning network-enabled plop that - when connected - allows
the connection of railroad tracks at the top of the ramp descending down to a connection
to the subway network at the bottom.  Trains visually descend into the 'pit' thanks to
Redlotus' pathing for the lot (thanks Red!).  This was able to happen because Equinox
'discovered' that referencing non-existant base textures in the game results in a 'see-
through' effect, just what was needed for this lot and its LODs to work 100% correctly.
In essence, this 'discovery' makes the full functionality of Marrast's underpasses a
reality, should anyone take the time to path them.


The lot works by converting entering subway or passenger rail traffic into "invisible"
traffic that emerges from the other side as the opposite network type.  The trains are
merely effects; no trains can drive on your subway tracks nor vice versa.  UDI is fully
compatible with the lot as well ... when you reach the end of the lot at the bottom,
however, the train will appear to "fall off".  This is normal and unavoidable due to the
methods we chose to use.

Note: Like the Maxis network transition (subway-to-elevated rail), this lot has a minor
'bug' that is visual only.  When plopping items around the lot, sometimes the ground
texture of SC4 will 'cut through' the lot.  The easiest way to fix it is to go into sub-
terranean view then quickly return to surface view.  It should look normal now.  The same
thing occurs with Maxis'.

Technical Info:

Lot Version 2.0 - updated on 02-September-2004
Issues Addressed: query reworked to accomodate the users reporting query bugs and
query-related crashing on other NDEX lots.  It also features the NDEX logo (designed
by Vidioman) and some random network statistics for the active city.  Most importantly
Equinox retextured the entire transition and also added a few details to better
accomodate residential- and commercial-district placement of the lot, rather than the
original's dark, industrial appearance.

Render #58 (yes, this has been rendered 58 separate times!)
Render Time: about 40 minutes for the final version.
