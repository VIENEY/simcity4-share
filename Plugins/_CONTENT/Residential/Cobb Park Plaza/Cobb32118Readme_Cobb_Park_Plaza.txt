The Cobb Park Plaza
A high wealth residential tower housing 1891 sims.  

The Cobb Park Plaza's design is highly unusual for a purpose: 
it allows for a lush, open-air garden to cover nearly the entire 
ground level, in spite of the building's large size.  Your wealthy 
sims may also avail themselves of the outside elevators, and the 
rooftop pavilion, for spectacular views of your city.

Installation instructions.

1) Extract the following 3 files to your Simcity4 plugins folder 
under the "My Documents" path (not the "Program files" path).

2) In SimCity4 RushHour, zone an area of 4x3 high-density residential
3) Just play!

Notes:

* The Cobb Park Plaza, like any other "growable," will show up only if 
your city has sufficient demand. If your city is constructing buildings 
like "The Primavera," "the Bradshaw," "Bell Towers," and "Quigley Place,"
then you will have a higher likelihood of seeing the C.P.P.  If you are 
not seeing any of those buildings, then you also will not see the C.P.P.
* Be sure you have installed all the latest updates to Simcity4 RushHour.
This will ensure that the building appears and functions correctly, and 
lights up at night.
* Thanks to many contributors who offered suggestions for improvements to
the building in my original posting in the BAT Open discussion forum.
