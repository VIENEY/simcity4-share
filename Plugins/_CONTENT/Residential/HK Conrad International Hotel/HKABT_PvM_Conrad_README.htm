<h2>Introduction / Overview</h2>
   <p>This building belongs to the Pacific Place Complex in Hong Kong (China). Pacific Place is a huge complex composed of five main buildings: Island Shangri-La Hotel, Conrad International Hotel, 3 Pacific Place, J.W. Marriott Hotel, and 1 Pacific Place. Most of the buildings mainly house hotels, but there are also apartments, offices and a huge shopping center inside the real-world complex.<br>
   Pacific Place was built in three phases. J.W. Marriott and One Pacific Place were erected in the first phase of construction (1988), Conrad and Shangri-La Hotel in the second (1991), and 3 Pacific Place in the third (2004).</p>
   <p>The Conrad International Hotel tower is the second tallest tower of the complex; it tops out at 199 m (653 ft). The actual hotel with its 511 rooms occupies the top 22 of the total 61 floors of the tower. The lower floors house apartments.<br><br>
Due to this property and since mixed-use buildings are not possible with SC4, the Conrad has been modded both as growable high-wealth hotel (CS$$$) called "Conrad International" and as growable high-wealth residential tower (R$$$) called "Conrad Apartments", even though the real apartments are apparently called "Parkside Apartments". Ploppable versions are provided as well. Since residential ploppables don't really work, you have the choice between a CS$$$ plop with jobs and a generic landmark.<br><br>
Both ploppable lots have the building overhanging a tiny core lot so that you can arrange the area around the base with plazas, parks and roads as you see fit. The irregularly shaped base is quite suitable for diagonal roads, which makes this download a good choice if you are looking for a nice and representative ploppable building to break up monotonous rectangular road layouts. A simple application example can be seen in the Hong Kong / Asia BAT Team thread on page 46, if you need some inspiration. ;)<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> This also means that this building shouldn't be plopped into a developed area because the lot itself doesn't indicate the size of the building. If you plop into an already developed part of your town, it is best to clear an area of at least 6x6 tiles and plop the building approximately in the middle.<br><br>
Once again, the growable lots come in two fashions: The 6x6 lots are made with dependencies; exactly the same ones that were used on the first Pacific Place release, the J.W. Marriott Hotel. The 6x5 lots, however, are totally dependency-free, but of course they don't look quite as nice as the 6x6 versions. Depending on your policy and attitude concerning dependencies, it is your choice which of the versions you prefer.</p>
<p></p>
   In total, the following versions are available:<br>
   <ul>
   <li>Ploppable landmark (5x2 lot with building overhanging the lot)</li>
   <li>Ploppable functional CS$$$ (5x2 lot with building overhanging the lot)</li>
   <li>Growable CS$$$ building (6x6 corner lot with dependencies)</li>
   <li>Growable CS$$$ building (6x5 corner lot without dependencies)</li>
   <li>Growable R$$$ building (6x6 corner lot with dependencies)</li>
   <li>Growable R$$$ building (6x5 corner lot without dependencies)</li>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Note: Ploppable and landmark versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which (the icon of the plop version is marked with 'CS$$$'), and the descriptions differ. Moreover, both versions are to be found conveniently grouped together near the bottom of your landmark menu. All Pacific Place lots will be sorted together below the other HKABT buildings, unless other installed plugins interfere with this sorting method.<br>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>The following dependencies are needed for the growable 6x6 versions only! Ploppable, landmark, and 6x5 growable lots have no dependencies.<br><br>

<p>_______<br>
*: Building overhangs the lot by approx. 2 tiles to the front and back and by 1 tile on the left side. It is recommended to leave some open space, plop the building at the desired position, and fill the space around the building as you like before developing the surrounding area. Plopping this building into the middle of a fully developed area could result in undesired glitches and visual (not technical!) conflicts with adjacent buildings, networks and developments.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First of all, it is recommended to unzip the entire content of this ZIP into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff from your backup archive into your plugins folder instead of having to download all plugins anew.</p>

<p>That said, in order to use this building in game, I suggest you first go to your plugins folder and make a sub-folder for the Conrad International Hotel.<br>
Then, simply copy the .sc4model file (the actual building model) plus the sub-folder(s) of whatever version(s) you'd like to use into the newly created Conrad International folder.</p>

<p>To uninstall a version you don't like, first bulldoze all instances of that version in your cities, then save the cities and exit. Now you can safely remove the version without running any risk to experience crashes or facing any other inconvenience.</p>
