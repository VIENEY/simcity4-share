The Cobb 5th Avenue --
3x3 Growable R$$$. 

The Cobb 5th Avenue is an early 20th Century luxury 
building for 711 high wealth sims. The 5th Avenue contains 
amenities such as an indoor pool, a fabulous ballroom on 
the 15th floor, a ground floor tea room, and numerous 
gathering places. 

To install the 5th Avenue, place the model, desc, and lot 
files in your MyDocuments\SimCity4\Plugins folder. The 
picture and readme files are optional, for quick ID and 
reference, but not needed for the building to work. 

None of my lots have any dependencies. 

To grow the 5th Ave, zone 3x3 dense residential. You will 
grow it if you are also growing similar-sized Maxis 
buildings, like "The Hogan."

The landmark version will appear in your landmarks menu. 

I hope you enjoy the Cobb 5th Avenue!
