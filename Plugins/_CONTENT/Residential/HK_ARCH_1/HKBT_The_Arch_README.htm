<h2>Introduction / Overview</h2>
   <p>The Arch is a brand-new residential building in Hong Kong, China. Its unique design consists of two towers that are connected at the upper half, thus resembling an arch. Moreover, the main sections of the building are not parallel to each other, but form a light curve. At a height of 231 m (758 ft), The Arch is currently the 14th tallest building in Hong Kong.</p>
   <p>This BAT is a true-to-life recreation of the original building, although the base has been modified a bit. There are two versions included in this download: The first version is a corner lot that imitates the real-life position of the building as closely as possible with the rigid SC4 grid. The disadvantage of this version is that most of the building's facades lie in the shadows due to the lighting rig in SC4.<br>
   The second version comes without large parts of the park at the base and is oriented in parallel with the grid. It gets illuminated by the game's lighting engine better, but is less close to the real-world building and somewhat less original in shape, although the lot is a mega lot.<br>
   <br>In total, you will find the following versions:
   <ul>
   <li>The Arch 1 (corner lot) - ploppable landmark (transit-enabled)</li>
   <li>The Arch 1 (corner lot) - growable R$$$ (transit-enabled)</li>
   <li>The Arch 1 (corner lot) - growable R$$$ (not transit-enabled)</li>
   <li>The Arch 1 (corner lot) - growable R$$ (transit-enabled)</li>
   <li>The Arch 1 (corner lot) - growable R$$ (not transit-enabled)</li>
   <li>The Arch 2 (straight lot) - ploppable landmark</li>
   <li>The Arch 2 (straight lot) - growable R$$$</li>
   <li>The Arch 2 (straight lot) - growable R$$</li>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Note: Both landmark versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to
see immediately which version is which. Moreover, both versions are to be found
conveniently grouped together near the bottom of your landmark menu. Besides, the description texts will tell you which version is which.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>It was very hard to whip up a lot that would look like a seamless extension of the main building, thus anchoring it on the ground in a natural way. However, I am glad to announce that I managed to use no more than one dependency for The Arch 1 (none for The Arch 2), namely Cerulean's base texture set, which is one of the best-known texture sets and has been used for many other buildings (including BSC and HKBT) already. This texture is a part of the:<br>
<a href="http://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=12646">BSC Textures MEGA Pack Vol 01</a><br><br>
(If you don't want to download the entire mega pack for some reason, you can also take the individual file:<br>
 <a href="http://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?keyword=Cerulean%20Textures%20V101">Cerulean_Textures_V101v5.dat</a>)<br><br>
 I also added some additional light cones which will enhance the look of the lot at night. This, however, is by no means an essential dependency. The lamps will look just fine without it, but even a tad better with it. So if you don't want to download the file, you won't be missing much. If you don't mind downloading the file, here's the link:<br>

<h2>Stats and Values</h2>
<p>All game-relevant values you might like to know are listed in the following overview tables. Please note that both versions of the Arch, though differing in lot size, share the same set of statistics.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First of all, it is recommended to unzip the entire content of this ZIP into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff from your backup archive into your plugins folder instead of having to download all plugins anew.</p>

<p>That said, in order to use this building in game, I suggest you first go to your plugins folder and make a sub-folder for The Arch.<br>
Then, simply copy the .sc4model file(s) (the actual building model) plus the sub-folder(s) of whatever version(s) you'd like to use into the newly created The Arch folder.<br>
Remember that you will need the building "The Arch 1" or the building "The Arch 2" for the corresponding lots, i.e. if you want to use lots with one of these numbers, make sure you have the building model for this number installed, or you will get brown boxes.<br>
Feel free to use as many or as few versions as you like; there are no conflicts whatsoever, and all 8 lots can coexist peacefully.</p>

<p>To uninstall a version you don't like, first bulldoze all instances of that version in your cities, then save the cities and exit. Now you can safely remove the version without running any risk to get crashes or facing any other inconvenience.</p>
