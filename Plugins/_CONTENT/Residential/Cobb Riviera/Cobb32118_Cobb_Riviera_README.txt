The Cobb Riviera: 

A high wealth residential apartment building
housing 346 sims.

The Cobb Riviera is the 2nd of my buildings inspired
by design elements from the Mediterranean, particularly 
the French and Italian Riviera.  But it was mostly
designed with the intention to provide relaxation and 
pleasant surroundings for its residents.  The
Riviera's rooftop and tower is a tranquil garden and
park. The Riviera is also intended to complement the 
design of the Cobb Europa in Old world style neighborhoods.  

There is a plopable landmark version included.

Thanks go to KD5RAX for modeling the trees, n74704, KD,
and Odd from Sweden for providing textures, and GOLDIVA 
for the lighting texture.  N74704 was the major design 
consultant.  Fosterk12345678910 modeled several of the 
small props.  I also received other numerous helpful 
suggestions during its creation from contributors in 
the BAT open discussion forum.

I hope that you enjoy the Cobb Riviera!  

Installation instructions.

1) Unzip all the included files (.SC4Desc, .SC4LOT, and .SC4Model) to
your Simcity plugin folder under the "My Documents" path.
2) In SimCity4 RushHour, zone an area of 4x3 high-density residential
3) Just play!

Notes:

* I DON'T PROVIDE AN RCI PLOPPABLE, BECAUSE THE GAME WILL NOT ALLOW
THE RESIDENTS TO COMMUTE, AND THE BUILDING ABANDONS.  That is why I
provide a landmark for those who would like to plop it.
* You must have sufficient R$$$ wealth demand to grow the 
Cobb Riviera, as with any growable building.
* Make sure that you have installed the BAT update from simcity.ea.com
in order for the lights to show up.
* It may take a few day/night cycles for the building to light up.
