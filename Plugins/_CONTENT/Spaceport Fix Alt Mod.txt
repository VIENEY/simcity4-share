Technical Notes:
----------------
This mod does not contain any copyrighted material, nor does it contain any graphics (hence its small file size). The plugin file contains exemplars that connect to the existing data contained in Simcity_1.dat. Since this mod is in the form of a simple Dat plugin file, it also does not alter your existing game files, and you can remove the mod simply by removing the Dat file. 


Disclaimer:
-----------
Users download, install, and run this mod completely at their own risk. Maxis and the web site you obtained this mod from are NOT responsible for any errors, crashes, problems or any other issue that you may have if you have downloaded and applied any mod files to your game. 

Players should also be forwarned that any future Official patches and/or expansion packs and also SimCityScape may not function properly with the game if you have downloaded any Unofficial mods/patches/files and applied them to your game. Any technical questions and/or problems that anyone may have with this mod should be directed to the proper Modding Forum section at Simtropolis or similar SC4 site.


Version Compatibility:
----------------------
This mod works with Rush Hour/Deluxe, and is not compatible with the original SimCity 4.


Mod Compatibility:
------------------
As this is the only Mod that deals directly with the Default Maxis Space Port, is it compatible and safe to use with all mods as of this release date, found on the Stex. (The AC Functional Airports Mod found at SC4Devotion.com modds this building in a large pack, so you may only use this Mod or that one.)
 

File Selection:
---------------
There are two .dat files contained in this upload. You MUST ONLY USE ONE (and delete or store the other somewhere NOT in your plugins folders). 

- 'SpacePort Fix Mod.dat' (Fix only)
- 'SpacePort Fix Alt Mod.dat' (Fix + some additional changes)


Installation/Removal:
---------------------
Before you install this mod, you MUST bulldoze any existing Space Ports in your cities! There may be complications and the Mod NOT work correctly if you don't bulldoze existing Space Ports first! Once you've done that, you can install the mod by simply placing 'SpacePort Fix Mod.dat' OR the 'SpacePort Fix Alt Mod.dat' alternate version in your plugins folder or any subfolder within it. (If you don't have a desired place to put it, you can create a subdirectory called 'Cougar2004' and place it there.)

Before removing this mod, you MUST bulldoze any Space Ports you built with it installed! Once you've done that, you can simply delete the mod file. 

Installation:
Copy 'SpacePort Fix Mod.dat' to 
	c:\Program Files\Maxis\SimCity 4\Plugins 

UnInstall:
Delete 'SpacePort Fix Mod.dat' from
	c:\Program Files\Maxis\SimCity 4\Plugins

Mod Details:
------------
This mod fixes a previously unknown problem with the default Maxis Space Port. The Space Port claims it "Provides a boost to high-tech industry" however, as verified in iLive Reader, it does not. Maxis forgot to include this boost in the building's exemplar, therefore it boosts nothing but costs and some slight commercial desirability.   

This mod fixes that. A significant yet realistic (non-radical) boost to High Tech Industry is now provided. Using this mod, placing the Space Port now provides 150,000 High-Tech Industry Cap Relief. This is well within the range of other similar buildings such as the Advanced Research Center, University, and Marina. 

 
An Alternate modded version has also been provided for those who feel the Maxis Space Port uses far too much power for its size and function. In addition to now providing the High-Tech Boost as originally intended, I've made several changes to the Space Port in this mod. First and most importantly, I've revised the power requirement downward from the original 700 to 219. This should allow most cities to stay safely under the power abilities of a single power plant with the Space Port placed.

For the Alternate Mod version I've also increased the Space Port from 100 R$$ Jobs to a more realistic spread of 8 R$, 104 R$$, and 16 R$$$, to cover the range of employees from Astronauts down to Janitorial staff. Water consumed has been decreased slightly from 360 to 248. And the Monthly Cost of this reward building is adjusted downward from $400/mo to $300/mo. The Bulldoze Cost of $4200 is now $3900. No other changes have been made to how the Space Port looks or functions.


Additional Notes:
-----------------
Players who win the Space Port through the two Required Train Missions early in a city's development will NOT see the High-Tech Boost of this mod initially. Only when you already have met all the requirements to have High-Tech Industry in your city and have hit the demand cap, will this fixed Space Port Reward building's High-Tech benefit be visible and of practical use to your city.

Currently, there are no issues or bugs known with this mod. If you think you've found a problem with this mod, please report it to me or in one of the Modding forums.

My mods are currently only available at Simtropolis. If you find my mods ANYWHERE else it is NOT with my authorization, and they may have been altered from my original version.
