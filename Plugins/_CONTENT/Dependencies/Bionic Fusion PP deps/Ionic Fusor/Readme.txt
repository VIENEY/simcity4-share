-----------------------
After extensive research, the sims have merged the ionizer with fusion technology to create a hybrid Ionic Fusor which lowers the cost of purchase and monthly operation while retaining the quad functionality of providing Power, Water, Pollution Filter and Water Treatment all in one building.
