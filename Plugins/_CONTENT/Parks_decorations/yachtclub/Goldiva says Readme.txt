GDV Roscoe Yacht Club by Goldiva [GDV]

Rush Hour Expansion: not required

Contains original GDV BAT 3d models = 2

MOD = Reward: pays $180 monthly coastal land lease fee to the city fund; increase high tech sector demand and draws rich sims to your city

Time taken for GDV to create and test all components =  200 hours; I'm getting better at BAT and MOD but this is still by far the toughest piece of work, involving insane amount of testing. The  foundation alone ate up more test time than the construction of club building, pier and boats. Such is the pain and joy of BAT Modelling... 

Will be really pissed off if others plagarize GDV original files without crediting Goldiva
 = YES!! Grrrrl

Will be really happy if SC fans just enjoy this GDV creation, and perhaps post your GDV Yacht Club screenshots at GDV's forum thread! I love feedback of the creative kind! :)

Unzip all files into My Documents/Simcity/Plugins

Good idea to start a GDV folder inside your Plugins folder: a few more new BAT/LOT items on the way
