Fellow citizens of Simtropolis!
I present you my first upload to STEX. 

SimFox’s CandyGarden is designed to add variety and shamelessly bright color to your cities!
Garden has same stats as games default large park with exception of Park Effect magnitude 
which ahs been increased from 20 to 50. Lot size is 3x4.

Feel free to express your opinions in any form you wish!

Installation is pretty straightforward - copy SimFox_CandyGarden folder from ZIP file into 
C:\…MyDocuments\Simcity4\Plugin folder. 
After that Garden will be available in Parks menu in game!
