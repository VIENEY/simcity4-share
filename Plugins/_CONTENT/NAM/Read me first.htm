      <p class="text_normal"><span class="Rot">Before</span> your run off in excitement and install the new NAM version, please make sure to <span class="Rot">read</span> this (short) document <span class="Rot">first</span> and then take action, otherwise some things might go wrong.</p>
      <p class="text_zwischentitel">Uninstalling the previous NAM version</p>
      <p class="text_normal">Since many things have changed compared to the last version   of the NAM, it is highly advised to <span class="Rot">uninstall</span> the current   version first. The original NAM download comes with an uninstaller, which is   either available via an entry in the start menu, or by double-clicking the   "uninst.exe" file in the NAM installation folder. If you have modified the NAM   files for yourself, please make sure to backup them to a safe place, so you can   apply the changes to the new NAM installation later.</p>
      <p class="text_zwischentitel">Using the BSC Cleanitol TM File</p>
      <p class="text_normal">wouangaine developed a tool that can remove outdated files from your plugins folder before installing a new download. Simply load the <em>Cleanitol_NetworkAddonMod.txt</em> in <strong>BSC Cleanitol TM</strong> and scan your plugins folders. BSC Cleanitol TM will move all files to the location you specified. This includes outdated NAM files, as well as beta versions and other outdated transit mods that might conflict with the NAM. However, it will not remove the outdated NAM readme files. Do <span class="Rot">not</span> use the Cleanitol file after you've installed the latest NAM, or you will have to install it again. If you're unsure what to install, pick one of the predefined profiles that are   available via the drop-down list at the top of the components list.   "Recommended" contains a selection of the most useful plugins.</p>
      <p class="text_zwischentitel">Installing the new NAM</p>
      <p class="text_normal">Don't simply click 'next' a few times, but take your time to actually <span class="Rot">read</span> the NAM  installer pages carefully. The installer features an <span class="Rot">optional components</span> selection page, where you can select optional plugins or different versions of a plugin. If you have installed (and used) optional components in the last version of the NAM, make sure to select them again.  If you forgot to select a component, simply hit 'back' until you get to the components selection, or run the installer again.</p>
      <p class="text_zwischentitel">Installing optional plugins</p>
      <p class="text_normal">Usually, you can install optional plugins at any time, but as a general suggestion, they should be installed <strong>after</strong> you performed a NAM installation/update.  If a plugin was released after the current NAM version, it might require an <strong>update</strong> of the NAM Controller, available in the <strong>NAM Essentials</strong>. Please check the release dates in order to make sure you have the latest NAM Controller files. The NAM contains the most recent NAM Controller files that are available at the release date, so you won't need to download the NAM Essentials if you want to upgrade the Real Highway Mod (RHW), Street Addon Mod (SAM), High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), Rail Addon Mod (RAM), Network Widening Mod (NWM) or additional bridges plugins that are released together with or shortly after the NAM.</p>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p class="text_normal">If you encounter any problems with non-functional items, missing models or textures, please try the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text_normal">Please <strong>re-read</strong> this installation guide and the readme file and verify that you followed all steps precisely. The NAM readme is quite extensive, but it covers virtually any problem that might arise.</li>
        <li class="text_normal">Check the <strong>version of your NAM installation</strong>. This can be done by checking the modification date of the NAM Controller (NetworkAddonMod_Controller.dat), which should have a date around the release. Also, the version number is always indicated in the NAM installer, and in the &quot;History&quot; file of the NAM readme. If you're not sure, uninstall your current NAM version, and download the latest version.</li>
        <li class="text_normal">Also, check if you have a <strong>right hand drive</strong> (RHD, i. e. US or German version) or <strong>left hand drive</strong> (LHD, i. e. UK or Japanese) version of the game, and make sure that you have the correct NAM Controller and the LHD plugin (if applicable) installed.</li>
        <li class="text_normal">Make sure that <strong>no outdated plugins</strong> and other transit-related mods are installed. Also, remove any beta version that might have been released prior to this release.</li>
        <li class="text_normal">If everything fails, <strong>remove</strong> everything from your plugins folder temporarily and install only the NAM (and the desired updates and plugins). If the NAM works properly now, you have a conflicting file in your plugins folder. Try to pinpoint it by adding half of your files back into the plugins folder, then test the NAM items in the game. If it doesn't work, try the other half of your plugins. Repeat this until you found the culprit, and remove it from your plugins folder.</li>
        <li class="text_normal">As a <strong>temporary</strong> solution, try to add some &quot;z_&quot; in front of the &quot;Network Addon Mod&quot; folder, so it's loaded <strong>after</strong> your plugins. This might bring back the functionality, because the current NAM Controller is overriding outdated plugins, but we suggest to do a proper research eventually, in order to find the conflicting plugin. If it's not included in the Cleanitol file that was delivered with the NAM, please report the filename to the NAM Team, so we can add it in future releases.</li>
        <li class="text_normal">As a general suggestion, you <strong>shouldn't</strong> use wouanagaine's SC4DatPacker for merging the NAM folder into your other plugins. The NAM will be updated continuously, so you should have the original folder structure available for performing an update. If you want to compress the NAM folder into a DAT file, please make sure that all files are layed out in the correct loading order before.</li>
