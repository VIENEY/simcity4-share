The Cobb Grand Plaza:  A high-wealth residential 
growable building housing 1151 sims.

This luxury apartment building is designed in a style
similar to the Cobb Park Plaza, elevated in order to
provide a large open garden space at ground level, where 
sims may stroll through the tropical foliage.  Also, like 
the Park Plaza, sims may take a dizzying elevator ride to
the observation and restaurant decks, or ride all the
way to the top in elevator 3 and relax in the rooftop
pool and hottub.

The rooftrop trees of the Grand Plaza were modeled by KD5rax.
The tables, umbrellas, and small potted plants on the rooftop
were modeled by fosterk12345678910.  The textures were shared
by n74704.  Thanks everyone for all your contributions!

Instructions:

Unzip all the included files into your plugin folder (in
the "my documents" path)   In order to grow the Cobb Grand
Plaza, simply zone 4x3 and play!  You must have the BAT update 
from simcity.ea.com installed for the night lights to display, 
and you must have sufficent demand for 1151 wealthy sims to move 
in.

I hope you enjoy the Cobb Grand Plaza!   -COBB
