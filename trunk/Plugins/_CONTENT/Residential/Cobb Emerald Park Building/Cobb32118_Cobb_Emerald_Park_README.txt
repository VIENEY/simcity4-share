The Cobb Emerald Park Building: 

A high wealth residential tower housing 1708 sims.  
The Cobb Emerald Park is a luxury apartment building
with an artistic tower at its apex, designed to provide
an attractive addition to your skyline.  The building is
illuminated with an emerald-themed green and blue night-
lighting  scheme.  Sims who live in the Cobb Emerald
Park building have access to several outdoor and indoor
parks, a swimming pool, a large recreational area in the
lobby, and an elevator-accessible observation level above
the Sky Park. 

There is a ploppable landmark version included.

Thanks go to KD5RAX for modeling the trees, n74704 and KD 
for providing textures, and GOLDIVA for providing multi-
colored lighting capabilities.  I also received numerous
helpful suggestions during its creation from contributors
in the BAT open discussion forum.

I hope that you enjoy the Cobb Emerald Park Building!

Installation instructions.

1) Unzip all the included files (.SC4Desc, .SC4LOT, and .SC4Model) to
your Simcity plugin folder under the "My Documents" path.
2) In SimCity4 RushHour, zone an area of 4x3 high-density residential
3) Just play!

Notes:

* Note that you must have sufficient high wealth demand to grow the 
Cobb Emerald Park building, as with any growable building.
* It may take a few day/night cycles for the building to light up.
