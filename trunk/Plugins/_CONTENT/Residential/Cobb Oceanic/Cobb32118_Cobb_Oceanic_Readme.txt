The Cobb Oceanic:  A high-wealth residential 
building housing 2256 sims.

If your sims are frustrated because hi-rise buildings 
only contain small apartments, then they will enjoy moving
into the Cobb Oceanic.  Each unit is a spacious and 
luxurious two-story townhouse, with private balconies 
and spectacular views.

The Cobb Oceanic also allows sims to relax in the rooftop
pool area, or stroll through the tropical foliage at ground
level.

Many people assisted me in this building's creation:
The rooftrop trees were modeled by KD5rax.
The tables, umbrellas, diving board, and small potted
plants on many of the balconies were modeled by
fosterk12345678910.  The textures are by n74704.  The
night-lighting texture was created by GOLDIVA.  Technical
and structural advice were given by CERULEAN and SimGoober.
Many others made helpful suggestions in the BAT open
discussion forum.  Thanks everyone for all your help!

Instructions:

Unzip all the included files into your plugin folder (in
the "my documents" path)   In order to grow the Cobb Oceanic, 
simply zone 4x4 and play!  You must have the BAT update from 
simcity.ea.com installed for the night lights to display, 
and you must have sufficent demand for 2256 wealthy sims to move in.

The building is a growable, but a landmark is also included
in the pack (but it will not contain residents).

I hope you enjoy the Cobb Oceanic!   -COBB
