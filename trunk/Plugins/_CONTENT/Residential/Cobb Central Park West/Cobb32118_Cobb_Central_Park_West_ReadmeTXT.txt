The Cobb Central Park West -- 
3x4 Growable R$$$ and/or ploppable CS$$ with jobs. 

The Cobb Central Park West is an early 20th Century 
luxury building for 785 high wealth residential dwelling 
sims, or 195 hotel service workers. The Central Park West
design was inspired by buildings you might see in the 
New York neighborhood of the same name. 

To install the C.P.W., place the model, desc, and lot 
files in your MyDocuments\SimCity4\Plugins folder. The 
picture and readme files are optional, for quick ID and 
reference, but not needed for the building to work. 

This lot does not have any dependencies.

To grow the C.P.W., zone 3x4 dense residential (with 3
tiles streetside -- Hold the ctrl key to keep out the 
auto-streets.) You will grow it if you are also growing 
similar-sized Maxis buildings, like "The Hogan."

To plop the C.P.W., zone 3x4 dense commercial (with 3 
tiles streetside), select the building from your landmark
menu, and plop it. The main query (not the transportation query)
 will show 195 jobs. Although 195 might be a low number for 
a typical building this size in SC4, hotels normally do not 
staff such high numbers. If you want a different number of 
jobs, it's extremely easy to edit this with Andreas Roth's 
SC4Tool.

I hope you enjoy the Cobb Central Park West!
