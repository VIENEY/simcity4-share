YOU MUST PLACE THE FOLLOWING FILE
"bsc_Essentials_OG.dat"
IN YOUR MAIN PLUGINS FOLDER, WITHOUT SUBDIRECTORIES.
My Documents\SimCity 4\Plugins\bsc_Essentials_OG.dat

It is absolutely critical that you do this.

It needs to be placed in one location so that future
installers or updates issued by the BSC, SimGoober,
Vlakhaas, Pegasus, etc. can be applied to the file
without duplicating it in your plugins folder, which
can tremendously slow down gameplay.

Also, you are advised to keep only one copy of the file
"NDEX Global Essentials.dat" in your plugins folder at
a time.  Overwriting it each time you download a new
NDEX lot is advised to make sure it stays up-to-date.

_______________________________________________________

If you are re-downloading an updated version of a lot,
you must delete all old versions of the associated lot
(particularly the old query file) before installing the
newer version.  Not doing so results in wasted RAM and
the potential for crashing.
