
*note*
sorry i did not include a growable version because the game does not let you create a lot larger then 6x6 thus i cannot make a growable version, if someone knows how to make a 7x7lot growable please let me know. thank you



to use the RCIploppable version:

extract the files inside of trans_pyramid_RCIploppable.zip into your My Documents\Simcity4\Plugins folder and extract transamerica pyramid-0x5ad0e817_0x8d2e3988_0x50000.SC4Model into the same folder. 

to use the landmark version:

extract the files inside of trans_pyramid_landmark.zip into your My Documents\Simcity4\plugins folder and extract transamerica pyramid-0x5ad0e817_0x8d2e3988_0x50000.SC4Model into the same folder...the landmark version will function just like a regular landmark.


make sure to always extract the "model" file in either case.


if you have any question or problems Im me or Email me or post it up at my forum "Transamerica Pyramid is live (by ed)" found in the BAT open discussion. 

Thank you.
