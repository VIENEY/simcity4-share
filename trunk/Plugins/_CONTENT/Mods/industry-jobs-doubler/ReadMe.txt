'Jobs Doubler' Mod Version 2.0
by Bones1


This mod doubles the number of jobs provided by the in-game industry buildings. There are 4 files you can optionally install; they double the jobs for each industry category (farming, dirty, manufacturing, and high-tech). So, you don't have to double all the industry categories if you don't wish to do so; you can pick & choose.

I made this mod after trying out the industry-quadrupler mod on this site. I found that mod to be unbalanced, and in the "cheat" category, so I made an alternative mod to be more balanced with the rest of the game.

1.  I only doubled the number of jobs, rather than quadrupled them. I found 4x was just too much.

2.  I doubled the building tax values. This makes the income from industry to be the same as the default for the same number of jobs. This allows a "industry city" to be economically feasible, just as with the default game values.

3. I doubled the power and water requirements for the buildings. This means you have to spend the same amount of money to support a similar number of jobs as you would with the game default. (I found this balance to be lacking in the industry quadrupler.)

4. I doubled the pollution from each building. Again, this means that the same amount of jobs will produce the same amount of pollution as with the game's default. (Again, missing in the 4x mod.) 




Version History:

V1.0:
Initial version of the mod.

v2.0
Same mod, but included optional doubling of air and water pollution values.


To Install:
Unzip the files and place into your My Documents\SimCity 4\Plugins folder.
There are four .dat files you can use.

dirty-doubler.dat  - Doubles jobs for dirty industry.
farm-doubler.dat  - Doubles jobs for farms.
hitech-doubler.dat  - Doubles jobs for high tech industry.
manufacturing-doubler.dat  - Doubles jobs for manufacturing industry.

dirty-doubler_includingPollution.dat  - Same as above, but also doubles pollution.
farm-doubler_includingPollution.dat  - Same as above, but also doubles pollution.
hitech-doubler_includingPollution.dat  - Same as above, but also doubles pollution.
manufacturing-doubler_includingPollution.dat  - Same as above, but also doubles pollution.


Install the appropriate four files if you wish to double all the jobs. If you don't want pollution values doubled, then install the blah.dat file instead of the blah_includingPollution.dat file.

Note that you may have to bulldoze existing industry buildings and let them regrow, after installing this mod, in order for all the new values to take affect.


To Uninstall:
Delete or move out of the Plugins folder.
