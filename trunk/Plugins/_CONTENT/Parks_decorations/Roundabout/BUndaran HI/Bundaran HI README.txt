In order to see night lighting, you need to have the EP1 Update 1 for Rush Hour/Deluxe installed, and then afterwards install the patch specifically for the BAT nightlighting, available on the "Building Architect Tool" page on the official Maxis website.  It is a separate download because it is optional. Note that you must be logged in to see the link.

If you do not have this installed, no custom model you
download will display any lighting effects at night.

recommendations for a better view, use the SimFox Day n Nite Modd
