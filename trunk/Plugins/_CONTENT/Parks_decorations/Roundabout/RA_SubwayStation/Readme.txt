Hello.
I made this station some time ago for my personal uses cause I love the NAM OneWay Roundabouts. But then I thought that you may find it useful. It's modeled after the station at the "Krumme Lanke" (a small lake in the Grunewald forest) in Berlin, but it's slightly different.
I also rendered a second time now and made a non-roundabout Lot for it if you won't only use it in roundabouts.

It has a capacity of 5,000 passengers, costs 30§/month to maintain, 5,000§ to plop. It also needs a bit of power (5 MW/h) and produces 4 tons of garbage.

I hope you enjoy it!
